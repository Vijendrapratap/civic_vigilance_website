            <p>
              <span className="text-cyan-400 font-semibold">Our cities are growing faster than ever</span>, 
              but our civic infrastructure often struggles to keep pace. Potholes go unfixed for months, 
              streetlights stay broken, illegal dumping becomes normalized, and public spaces deteriorate.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="text-purple-400 font-semibold">The gap isn't just about resources</span>‚Äîit's 
              about awareness. Government bodies can't be everywhere at once. They rely on us, the citizens, 
              to be their eyes and ears. When we stay silent, problems persist. When we speak up, change happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="text-green-400 font-semibold">But here's the challenge</span>: traditional 
              complaint systems are fragmented, slow, and often discouraging. People don't report issues 
              because they don't believe anything will change. That's where civic vigilance comes in‚Äînot 
              as a burden, but as an empowerment tool.
